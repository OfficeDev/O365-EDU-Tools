========================
 Required Prerequisites
========================

1. Install Microsoft Graph Powershell Module with command 'Install-Module Microsoft.Graph'

2.  Make sure to download common.ps1 to the same folder of the script which has common functions needed.  https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-EDU-Tools/blob/master/SDS%20Scripts/common.ps1

3. Check that you can connect to your tenant directory from the PowerShell module to make sure everything is set up correctly.

    a. Open a separate PowerShell session
    
    b. Execute: "connect-graph -scopes GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All" to bring up a sign in UI. 
    
    c. Sign in with any tenant administrator credentials
    
    d. If you are returned to the PowerShell sesion without error, you are correctly set up

4. Retry this script.  If you still get an error about failing to load the Microsoft Graph module, troubleshoot why "Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -MinimumVersion 0.9.1" isn't working

(END)
