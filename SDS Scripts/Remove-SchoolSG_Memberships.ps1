.SYNOPSIS
This script is designed to remove all School Security Group (SG) memberships created by SDS from an O365 tenant. The script connects to Microsoft Graph, retrieves all school SG memberships, exports them to a CSV file in the output folder, and then prompts for confirmation before removing the memberships. Users can edit the CSV file to exclude specific memberships before confirming deletion.
Once the script completes, CSV and log files will be created in the specified output folder detailing the school SG memberships that were removed.

.EXAMPLE
.\Remove-SchoolSG_Memberships.ps1

.NOTES
========================
 Required Prerequisites
========================

1. Install Microsoft Graph Powershell Module with command 'Install-Module Microsoft.Graph'

2.  Make sure to download common.ps1 to the same folder of the script which has common functions needed.  https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-EDU-Tools/blob/master/SDS%20Scripts/common.ps1

3. Check that you can connect to your tenant directory from the PowerShell module to make sure everything is set up correctly.

    a. Open a separate PowerShell session
    
    b. Execute: "connect-graph -scopes GroupMember.ReadWrite.All, Group.ReadWrite.All, Directory.ReadWrite.All, Directory.AccessAsUser.All" to bring up a sign in UI. 
    
    c. Sign in with any tenant administrator credentials
    
    d. If you are returned to the PowerShell session without error, you are correctly set up

4. Retry this script.  If you still get an error about failing to load the Microsoft Graph module, troubleshoot why "Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -MinimumVersion 0.9.1" isn't working
