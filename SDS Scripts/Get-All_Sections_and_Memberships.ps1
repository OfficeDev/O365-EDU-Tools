.SYNOPSIS
This script will export all O365 Groups and their respective memberships. The result will be a CSV file, called Get-All_Sections_and_Memberships.csv. To run this script, you will first need to establish a PowerShell connection to Azure AD and Exchange Online.

.PARAMETER outFolder
Path where to put the csv output file.

.EXAMPLE
.\Get-All_Sections_and_Memberships.ps1

.NOTES
***This script may take a while.***

========================
 Required Prerequisites
========================

1. Install Exchange Online Management Module with command 'Install-Module ExchangeOnlineManagement'

2. Check that you can connect to your tenant directory from the PowerShell module to make sure everything is set up correctly.

    a. Open a separate PowerShell session
    
    b. Execute: "Connect-ExchangeOnline" to bring up a sign-in UI. 
    After you complete the login in the web browser, the session in the Powershell window is authenticated via the regular Azure AD authentication flow, and the Exchange Online cmdlets are imported after few seconds.
    
    c. If you are returned to the PowerShell session without error, you are correctly set up.
