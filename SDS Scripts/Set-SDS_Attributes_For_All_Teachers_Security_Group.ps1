========================
 Required Prerequisites
========================

1. Install Microsoft Graph Powershell Module with the command 'Install-Module Microsoft.Graph'

2. Check that you can connect to your tenant directory from the PowerShell module to make sure everything is set up correctly.

    a. Open a separate PowerShell session
    
    b. Execute: "Connect-Graph" to bring up a sign-in UI. 
    
    c. Sign in with any tenant administrator credentials.
    
    d. If you are returned to the PowerShell session without error, you are correctly set up.

3.  Ensure that you have access to the following permission scopes: Group.ReadWrite.All

4.  Retry this script.  If you still get an error about failing to load the Microsoft Graph module, troubleshoot why "Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication" isn't working.
