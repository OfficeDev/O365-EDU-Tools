Script Name:
Remove-All_SchoolAU_Memberships.ps1

Synopsis:
This script is designed to remove all School AU Membershipss created by SDS from an O365 tenant. The script sets up the connection to Azure, and then confirm you want to run the script with a "y". Once the script completes, a file will be created in the same directory as the script itself, and contain an output file which details the school AU memberships removed.

Syntax Examples and Options:
.\Remove-SchoolAU_Memberships.ps1

Written By: 
SDS Team, and adapted by Ayron Johnson

========================
 Required Prerequisites
========================

1. Install Microsoft Graph Powershell Module with command 'Install-Module Microsoft.Graph'

2.  Make sure to download common.ps1 to the same folder of the script which has common functions needed.  https://github.com/OfficeDev/O365-EDU-Tools/blob/master/SDS%20Scripts/common.ps1

3. Check that you can connect to your tenant directory from the PowerShell module to make sure everything is set up correctly.

    a. Open a separate PowerShell session
    
    b. Execute: "connect-graph -scopes AdministrativeUnit.ReadWrite.All, User.Read.All" to bring up a sign in UI. 
    
    c. Sign in with any tenant administrator credentials
    
    d. If you are returned to the PowerShell sesion without error, you are correctly set up

5. Retry this script.  If you still get an error about failing to load the Microsoft Graph module, troubleshoot why "Import-Module Microsoft.Graph.Authentication -MinimumVersion 0.9.1" isn't working

(END)
