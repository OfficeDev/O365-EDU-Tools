.Synopsis
    Resolves sync issues between Azure Active Directory (AAD) and the Teams internal directory where owners who were present in AAD could not
    always see the Team.  This script works for SDS created Teams.  The script will find all owners of a Team in AAD and then add those users
    to the Team directly using the beta/teams/<id>/members Microsoft Graph endpoint.

    Depending on the number of groups SDS has created that have been provisioned, the processing for All SDS teams could take several hours.
    It is recomended to only process a single teacher's classes instead.

.Requirements
    Install the Microsoft.Graph.Authentication PowerShell modules, version 0.9.1 or better.

    For machine setup, the PowerShell script may need to be launched in Administrator mode

.Example
    -For a specific user
    .\Add-Group-Owners-To-Teams.ps1 -EducatorUPN john.smith@school.edu
    -For all SDS Teams
    .\Add-Group-Owners-To-Teams.ps1
    -Include archived teams.
    .\Add-Group-Owners-To-Teams.ps1 -includeArchived
