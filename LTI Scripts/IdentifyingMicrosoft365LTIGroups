Groups created to support the OneDrive LTI have a few specific property values that other Groups do not have.

Find M365 Groups created by the OneDrive LTI
We will be using the groups endpoint.

To identify groups created via the OneDrive LTI, we will filter looking for groups where the displayName starts with 'Course:' and the description contains the issuerName tag matching the name of the LMS.

Graph API Request:

GET https://graph.microsoft.com/v1.0/groups?$count=true&$search="description:issuerName: Canvas"&$select=id,displayName,email,description
In the above API call you must replace Canvas with the issuerName of your LMS in the $search expression. Possible values for issuerName are: Canvas, Schoology, Blackboard, and Generic. These values are case sensitive.

Graph API Request headers (required): ConsistencyLevel:eventual (more info)

Graph Permissions Required: Directory.Read.All, Group.Read.All

User/Application Context: If using delegated permissions with a particular user context, the query will only return Groups that the user is a member of. If run as a Global Administrator, or with Admin consented context then all Groups meeting the criteria can be viewed.

This will return the total count, and a list of all OneDrive LTI groups including id, displayName, mail (upn), and description properties. To return additional property values, add them to the comma delimited $select statement in the request.

More than likely, you will see an @odata.nextLink property at the beginning of the response. This means you are not getting a full list, and you will need to page the data.

Powershell script example
A Powershell script example to log Groups created by the OneDrive LTI is also available.
