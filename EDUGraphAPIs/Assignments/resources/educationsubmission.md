# educationSubmission resource type

Submissions are owned by an assignment. A submission represents the resources that an individual (or group) turn in for an assignment and the grade/feedback that is returned.
Submissions are automatically created when an assignment is published. The submission owns two lists of resources. Resources represent the user/groups working area while the submitted resources represent the resources that have actively been turned in by students.  

>**Note:** The status is read-only and the object is moved through the workflow via actions.
