# educationAssignment resource type

The **educationAssignment** resource represents a task or unit of work assigned to a student or team member in a class as part of their study. Only teachers or team owners can create assignments. Assignments contain handouts and tasks that the teacher wants the student to work on. Each student assignment has an associated [submission](educationsubmissionresource.md) that contains any work their teacher asked to be turned in. A teacher can add scores and feedback to the submission turned in by the student.

When an assignment is created, it is in a Draft state. Students can't see the assignment and submissions won't be created. You can change the status of an assignment by using the [publish](../api/educationassignment_publish.md) action. You can't use a PATCH request to change the assignment status.

The assignment APIs are exposed in the class namespace.
